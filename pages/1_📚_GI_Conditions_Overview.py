'Dyed-lifted' refers to a technique used during removal (polypectomy) where dye (like indigo carmine) is injected under the polyp to lift it from the colon wall, making removal easier and safer. This image class captures the appearance after this procedure.",
    "dyed-resection-margins": "After removing a polyp or lesion, the edges ('margins') of the removal site are often dyed. This helps the endoscopist assess if the removal was complete (no abnormal tissue left behind). Clear margins are crucial to prevent recurrence.",
    "esophagitis": "Inflammation of the esophagus, the tube connecting the throat to the stomach. It can be caused by acid reflux (most common), infections, allergies, or certain medications. Endoscopically, it may appear as redness, swelling, erosions, or ulcers.",
    "normal-cecum": "The cecum is the beginning of the large intestine (colon), connecting the small intestine (ileum) to the colon. A 'normal cecum' view shows healthy tissue, often including the appendiceal orifice (opening to the appendix) and the ileocecal valve.",
    "normal-pylorus": "The pylorus is the muscular valve ('pyloric sphincter') at the exit of the stomach, controlling the flow of food into the small intestine (duodenum). A 'normal pylorus' view shows a healthy, functioning sphincter without inflammation, ulcers, or obstruction.",
    "normal-z-line": "The Z-line (or squamocolumnar junction) is the boundary in the lower esophagus where the squamous lining of the esophagus meets the columnar lining of the stomach. A 'normal Z-line' is sharp and regular, indicating no significant metaplasia (like Barrett's esophagus).",
    "polyps": "Abnormal growths protruding from the lining of the GI tract, most commonly the colon. While many are benign, some types (adenomatous polyps) can become cancerous over time. Endoscopic removal is key for colorectal cancer prevention.",
    "ulcerative-colitis": "A chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and ulcers primarily in the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. Endoscopy shows characteristic inflammation patterns."

    "normal-pylorus": "Anatomical landmark in upper endoscopy.",
    "normal-z-line": "Important landmark for assessing conditions like GERD and Barrett's esophagus.",
    "polyps": "Colonic polyps are common, especially in older adults. Prevalence increases with age. Screening colonoscopy aims to detect and remove them.",

# Textual context about global relevance
st.markdown("""
Gastrointestinal diseases represent a significant global health burden.
* **Colorectal Cancer (CRC):** Conditions like polyps are precursors to CRC, one of the most common cancers worldwide. Screening programs involving endoscopy aim to detect and remove polyps early, significantly reducing CRC mortality. As of 2025, many countries continue expanding their screening initiatives.
* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):** Diseases like Ulcerative Colitis affect millions, with a noticeable increasing prevalence in newly industrialized countries across Asia and South America, adding to the high rates in North America and Europe. Research into microbiome and targeted therapies is very active.
* **Esophageal Conditions:** Esophagitis linked to GERD remains extremely common globally, impacting quality of life. Early detection and monitoring of related changes like Barrett's esophagus are crucial for preventing esophageal adenocarcinoma, the rates of which have risen in some populations over recent decades.

**AI in Endoscopy:** Artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into clinical practice to aid endoscopists in detecting subtle lesions like polyps and early cancer, improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This system is an example of such technology applied to the Kvasir dataset for educational and research exploration.
